Task 1 - data retrieval and data processing

===============================================================================

First task for my MSc project.

I need to get the patient data from the TCGA website using wget, for all of the
cancer types.

After that, will need to process the data into something useful.

As mentioned above, I need to download data from the TCGA website using 
wget.

First, I need to get the names of the cancer types, since wget doesn't
allow wildcard characters for HTML URLs.

    Download index.html file:
        wget https://tcga-data.nci.nih.gov/tcgafiles/ftp_auth/distro_ftpusers/anonymous/tumor/

    Strip the html tags:
        sed -e 's/<[a-zA-Z\/][^>]*>//g' index.html > index2.html

    Use Vim to delete all the unwanted characters and spaces, so you're 
    just left with the cancer names.

Once I get the cancer names, then I can loop over the names to download
the required patient data.

The URL will be in the form of:

https://tcga-data.nci.nih.gov/tcgafiles/ftp_auth/distro_ftpusers/anonymous/tumor/**cancer**/bcr/biotab/clin/nationwidechildrens.org_clinical_patient_**cancer**.txt

where **cancer** is where the cancer name gets inserted.

wget allows file input, so use for loop to read from the cancer names file,
make the appropriate URL, then append it to a separate file.

    Check out the make_url code

Use this file (cancer_urls.txt) as the input file for wget.

    Make patient_data directory and run the wget:

        wget -P patient_data/ -i cancer_urls.txt

-P flag lets you specify the target directory, -i flag lets you specify
the input file.

The files downloaded have long names, so rename all of them to just the
cancer name.

Out of 38 cancer subtypes that I thought I have downloaded, 5 subtypes didn't 
have the clinical patient data. These were: cntl, fppp, lcml, lnnh, misc.

Renamed everything to **cancer**_patient_data.txt using a simple for loop
on command line.
    Create another index file from index2.html, but remove the 5 subtypes.
    See rename file for the loop

Make a file with all the filenames in it.

Now it's ready to load into R.

Data has been loaded into R (see task1.R for details)

Out of 33 cancer subtypes, there were only 14 subtypes that had both height
and weight data.

From these data, I've identified the patients that have both height and weight 
data. 

Note from Mik: 
    - wants a table of subtypes and the number of patients with H/W data
        > Probably give him the list of the data with all the 
            H/W patient information.

Exported the list as 'BMI_data.txt'. (see code for details)
