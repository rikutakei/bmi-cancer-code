Task 2 - looking at UCEC RNA-seq data

===============================================================================

Look at the RNA-seq data of UCEC (endometrial cancer) and perform singular 
value decomposition (SVD) to identify obesity related metagene.

Compare/validate these genes with the Creighton et al. obesity metagene (799
genes).
    - should show if obesity metagene can be used across cancer types

Goal/To-do:
    - reorganise RNA-seq data into usable format
    - validate Creighton et al. metagene by either:
        1) extracting the genes in Creighton et al. genes from the 
            UCEC data, do SVD, and compare the metagenes, OR
        2) make obesity metagene from the UCEC clinical data and RNA-seq
            data, and then compare this metagene with the Creighton et al.
            metagene (see how well the genes match up)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Have downloaded UCEC microarray and RNA-seq data from ICGC database (check 
the ICGC website).

Load the RNA-seq data into R.
    - data has a raw read count variable which I can use for SVD

Need to reorganise the data into genes-by-samples matrix
    - use dplyr (look at the R code)

===============================================================================

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There's about 541 samples and 20502 genes.
    - Took about 1 second per gene, so about 5 hours to run/make the whole 
        raw read count file
        - stored in the data/task02 directory as raw_read_count.txt

Need to get the obesity gene probes from the Creighton et al paper
    - move the data from the bmi-markdown directory

The obesity gene file doesn't actually have the gene names in it
    - Need to identify it by annotating the obesity probe IDs

When the 799 obesity probes were annotated (using the 'select' function),
the probes mapped to 875 genes
    - Some of them were NAs, but some had multiple genes per probes
    - there were 755 unique genes (excluding the NAs)

Was able to keep it to 799 when I used the 'mapIds' function, but don't know
if this is any good.
    - there were 692 unique genes (excluding the NAs)

Using the 692 unique genes from mapIds function, need to check which genes
are actually present in the raw data
    - there were 645 out of 692 genes present in the raw data

Extracted these 645 genes for all the samples and put it into a matrix.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When I standardised the data to have Mean of 0, and standard deviation of
1, I kept getting NA as a result
    - Found out that there was a single row that had NAs (row 221)
    - removed the row and everything ran fine

Now I'll have to match the clinical data (i.e. BMI) with the RNA-seq data

Imported the TCGA clinical data into R
    - extracted the height and weight data from it
    - need to calculate the BMI for each patient

The problem with the TCGA and ICGC data is that the sample names are a
little bit different
    - ICGC have extra trailing random ID numbers...

Used gsub to remove the extra IDs
    - see code


===============================================================================

17 June 2015

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Created a matrix of height and weight data (hwdata - see code)
    - remove the '[Not Available]' samples
        - resulted in 512 valid samples with both height and weight data

Need to calculate the BMI status for each of the samples
    - BMI = weight/(height)^2

Converted the height/weight data into numerical matrix from character matrix
    - I hate factors...

Found a sample that has a wrong height data
    - probably 166cm instead of 66cm

Need to match which samples are in the raw read count data
    - matched the samples with BMI
        - total of 511 samples (but with some duplicates - different samples
            from the same patient??)
        - need primary tumour data ONLY
            - might have other samples in there that is making the duplicates
            - need to re-extract the RNA-seq data

Got the specimen.UCEC-US.tsv file from the ICGC data portal
    - contains the tumour sample type data

Even after extracting only primary tumours, there were 21 duplicates and 3
triplicates

===============================================================================

25 June 2015

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There were 21 duplicates and 3 triplicates in the sample names out of
509 primary tumour samples in the data set
    - see the code for the duplicates and triplicates

Able to get the duplicating samples - plot them to assess which one
is the bad one
    -heat map?

===============================================================================

25 June 2015

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Outputted the heatmaps to 'replicates.pdf'

Need to decide which sample to use in the SVD
    - see code

Managed to do the SVD analysis and produced heatmaps
    - seems like the higher the BMI, the lower the gene expression

Notes from the meeting:

Quality assessment:
    - make density plots for all the samples (on log scale)
        -should look similar and bad samples will deviate
    - calculate correlation matrix for samples across all genes.
        - plot this as a heatmap
        - good samples should cluster together
            - correlation for good samples should be >0.6
        -use hclust and cutree to identify poor samples and remove these
    - remake correlation matrix 
        - repeat until no bad samples

Replicate picking:
    - make scatterplots of the replicate pairs
        - all genes, use pch='.' to get small points
    - use the heatmap of the sample correlation matrix to help figure out which replicates to use

Normalisation:
    - use the limma voom function  on the count data 
        - see the limma user guide
    - remove genes with low count values before running voom
    - remake the density plots to see if the samples are now fairly uniform

Metagene creation:
    - see the code in the email

Compare to clinical variables:
    -scatterplot of BMI vs BMI metagene
    -boxplot of BMI groups (<25, 25~30, >30) vs BMI metagene
    - plot BMI metagenes against other variables

Extra:
    - do differential expression analysis of BMI>30  vs BMI<30 in the endometrial data (limma)
    - do the significant genes overlap with the list of 799?
    - use these genes to create a BMI metagene and compare with BMI and other clinical variables

===============================================================================

20 July 2015

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Have done some of the stuff on the analysis notes.

Some difficulties and problems:
    - not sure how to interpret the scatterplot for the replicates
        -> check what kind of sample these are
        -> doesn't look too different, so pick one
    - Do I do voom normalisation first before the correlation matrix analysis?
        -> probs not
    - I did the correlation matrix thing on the raw data, without normalising etc... do I have to normalise it first?
        -> NO - don't want to normalise crappy data first (gonna make it harder to determine the shitty data)


===============================================================================

22 July 2015

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Need to do a SVD on the Creighton et al data to get a transformation matrix.
    - the number of genes used in the SVD must match the number of genes in
      the endometrial cancer data
    - multiple probes may match to a single gene in the Creighton data

There were 777 genes (out of 799) that were not NAs

There were 695 unique genes within the 777 non-NA genes

There were 643 genes from the Creighton data that matched in the endometrial cancer data
    - when I checked back to the Creighton data, all 643 genes were unique
        - i.e. no need to merge any genes - just use these 643 genes

Now I have to SVD the 643 genes by 103 samples and take the transformation matrix to the endometrial cancer data.
