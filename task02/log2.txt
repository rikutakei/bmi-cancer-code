Task 2 - looking at UCEC RNA-seq data

===============================================================================

Look at the RNA-seq data of UCEC (endometrial cancer) and perform singular 
value decomposition (SVD) to identify obesity related metagene.

Compare/validate these genes with the Creighton et al. obesity metagene (799
genes).
    - should show if obesity metagene can be used across cancer types

Goal/To-do:
    - reorganise RNA-seq data into usable format
    - validate Creighton et al. metagene by either:
        1) extracting the genes in Creighton et al. genes from the 
            UCEC data, do SVD, and compare the metagenes, OR
        2) make obesity metagene from the UCEC clinical data and RNA-seq
            data, and then compare this metagene with the Creighton et al.
            metagene (see how well the genes match up)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Have downloaded UCEC microarray and RNA-seq data from ICGC database (check 
the ICGC website).

Load the RNA-seq data into R.
    - data has a raw read count variable which I can use for SVD

Need to reorganise the data into genes-by-samples matrix
    - use dplyr (look at the R code)
