# bmi-cancer-code
This will be the repository I’ll be uploading all of my codes used in my MSc project.

I will try and keep this repo as organised as I can, grouping all my progresses in distinct folders, etc.

## “task” folders
These folders will have all the codes required to do a single ‘chunk’ of analysis. It’ll also have some notes/logs of what
I’ve done for the task.
