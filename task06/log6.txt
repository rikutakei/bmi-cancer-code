-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Downloaded 7 cancer data from ICGC website
    - couldn't find 6 cancers out of 14 in total

7 cancer data downloaded were: BLCA, CESC, COAD, KIRP, LIHC, READ, and SKCM.

The 6 cancer data not on ICGC were: CHOL, DLBC, ESCA, THYM, UCS and UVM.
    - esophageal cancer (ESCA) doesn't have any RNA-seq data, which is a bit dissapointing...

Loaded all 7 cancer data into R
    - seems like there are unknown genes in the data (shown as '?')
        - going to remove these for now
    - seems like there are duplicate samples as well...
        - will have to merge these into one (maybe use WGCNA?)
