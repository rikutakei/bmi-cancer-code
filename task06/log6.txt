Downloaded 7 cancer data from ICGC website
    - couldn't find 6 cancers out of 14 in total

7 cancer data downloaded were: BLCA, CESC, COAD, KIRP, LIHC, READ, and SKCM.

The 6 cancer data not on ICGC were: CHOL, DLBC, ESCA, THYM, UCS and UVM.
    - esophageal cancer (ESCA) doesn't have any RNA-seq data, which is a bit dissapointing...

Loaded all 7 cancer data into R
    - seems like there are unknown genes in the data (shown as '?')
        - going to remove these for now
    - seems like there are duplicate samples as well...
        - will have to merge these into one (maybe use WGCNA?)

Wrote a function to transform the ICGC data into a matrix form, but this function takes quite a while to run
    - it does take care of any duplicates and '?' genes though
        - for duplicates, maximum value was used

I thought some of the data sets had samples with varying number of unique genes, but I couldn't find which one it was...
    - my function should have taken care of this, but I'm still a bit worried

All the raw read counts are stored as a txt file

Now I need to analyse all 8 cancer data

Loaded all the BMI data into R
    - made a matrix for each cancer type (stored it as ~~~~bmi.txt)

Identified which samples in each cancer type have BMI data
    - see code

Almost ready for the analyses
    - log, standardise, transform, etc

Used WGCNA's collapseRows function to remove duplicate samples

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Loaded the raw data from Creighton
    - re-checked that the metagene correlates with BMI (it did)

Looped over all 8 cancer types (log10, standardise, then heatmap)
    - the heatmaps are not looking good
        - maybe I did something wrong in the making of the actual data

Found the bug!!!
    - I was standardising the data based on the samples, rather than the genes
        - i.e. each sample had mean=0,sd=1 over all genes
