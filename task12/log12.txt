Need to check whether the obesity-related markers are being affected
by other factors (e.g. age, grade)
    - fit linear model, then use the residuals from it so the
        variables are removed from the data.

Pseudocode:
    - remove all of the possible variables affecting the data (except
        obesity)
    - do differential expression analysis using obese vs non-obese
        samples
    - check if the DEGs matches the obesity-specific probes they have
        found in their paper.

Did DEG analysis on the residuals of the data
    - came up with about 4000 genes with p < 0.05
        - only about half of the Creighton obesity-related genes were
            included in this list

Do DEG on the original/raw data using obese vs non-obese design matrix
    - see if the same genes come up

All of the obesity-related genes from Creighton data showed up in the
top table, but not all were in the top 799 genes (p value-wise).

There were only 132 genes that had a fold change (not logFC) greater
than 1.2 (which is how Creighton got the gene probe set in the first
place).

390 obesity probes from Creighton data were in the top table with
p-value < 0.01

Both metagenes (Creighton and mine) were  able to separate obese samples
from non-obese samples.
    - there were overlap of 239 probes between these obesity-related markers

Used the 239 overlapping probes to see if it can separate the obese
from non-obese samples.
    - it could separate the groups as well as the other sets of
        obesity related probes.

Pulled out the top 799 probes from the residual data and compared it with
the other metagenes
    - it matched 423 probes in my obesity related probes.
    - it matched 168 probes from Creighton signature
    - it matched 112 probes from overlap signature

Only 216 probes from the creighton obesity-related probes were present
in the residual top table (p < 0.01)
    - means that of those 390 overlapping genes that matched, 216 of them
        remained after controlling for all other clinical variables.

Re-do the analysis, but only use the caucasian samples
    - remove the effect of race completely from the analysis/linear model

----------------------------------------------------------------------

There were different genes in my 799 obesity genes compared with the
799 genes found in the residual data. However, when  you only worked
with caucasian samples, the top 799 genes found in the non-residual
data were identical to those found in the residual data.
    - The difference in genes found in the first analysis may have
        been accounted for by the presence of caucasian samples?

The results shown above was due to a bug in my code.
    - there were no overlaps of the genes between the non-residual
        and the residual data in caucasian samples

Use the genes from the analyses to transform the TCGA data
    - use residual (my, cr, red), caucasian (cr, ca), and
        causcasian residual (cacrres, cares) genes

None of the metagenes found from the Creighton data correlated with
BMI in any of the TCGA data.
