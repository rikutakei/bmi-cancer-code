Thought the task02 code was getting too long, so starting up a new one for differential expression analysis.

Started working on the DEG analysis

There were 482 samples in the data that also had a BMI data (no duplicates).

Normalising using voom function from limma.
    -removed genes with small count data (from 20502 genes to 19257 genes)

The top table (and volcano plot) doesn't show any gene that is differentially expressed...
