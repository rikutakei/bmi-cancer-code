Thought the task02 code was getting too long, so starting up a new one for differential expression analysis.

===============================================================================

5 August 2015

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Started working on the DEG analysis

There were 482 samples in the data that also had a BMI data (no duplicates).

Normalising using voom function from limma.
    -removed genes with small count data (from 20502 genes to 19257 genes)

The top table (and volcano plot) doesn't show any gene that is differentially expressed...

===============================================================================

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Did DEG analysis - found 218 genes between obese vs non-obese patients.

The metagene produced doesn't look too good...
    - maybe because I did the sample quality control stuff after the DEG analysis
        - do quality control before the DEG analysis, then re-do the metagene stuff.

===============================================================================

14 August 2015

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Reduced the samples from 482 samples to 322 samples (last cutree had to be k = 4)
    - most of them are above 0.6 correlation, but some are just below 0.6
    - didn't want to cut too many samples for DEG

Out of 322 samples, 199 samples were obese, 60 were normal, and 63 were overweight
    - 199 obese vs 123 normal/overweight

DEG analysis showed that there were only 4 genes that were differentially expressed between the obese vs. non-obese samples
    - Don't know what's going wrong here, but it might be due to the poor quality of the endometrial RNA-seq data in general
        -apparently the breast cancer data started from 0.75 correlation.

Now, I need to forget/leave the UCEC data and look into other cancer types
    - see if other cancer types have any correlation between BMI and gene expression
