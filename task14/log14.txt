Starting on making Gatza's results

Data were downloaded from GEO and the GSE IDs were:
	- GSE1456 GSE1561 GSE2034 GSE3494 GSE3744 GSE4922 GSE5460 GSE5764 GSE6596
	  - 6 of these had hgu133a data

Only the hgu133a samples were used to make the results from the Gatza paper
	- (how many samples?)

Checked the direction of the metagenes in Gatza's dataset
	- Initially checked the direction using both the corresponding genes and the correlation of the metagene with that gene
		- The heatmap of the pathway metagenes didn't look like the figure in Gatza paper, so decided to flip the metagenes based on their figure

===============================================================================

13 July 2016

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Gatza's materials and methods section says that they used mas5 normalisation method, so I am going to try this and see if I'll get the same results
	- still can't get the same heatmap as their figure...
		- (have tried with/without ranking metagene, svd on raw/std data, etc.)
	- maybe the metagene flipping is wrong...?

Might have to choose the flipping directions by "copying" their figure...?

===============================================================================

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Forgot to log2 the mas5 normalised data
	- log2 the data, and see if it changes anything

Close to their results using mas5 normalised, log2, and no standardisation of the data

Looking back at Gatza's supplementary methods section, they have used Bayesian Factor Regression Model to normalise the data
	- since the data were all from independent studies, they had to 'normalise' the data to remove the cohort effect
		- Tom said to use 'ComBat' to remove the cohort (in sva package)

===============================================================================

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Re-trying the gatza pathway direction/metagene stuff after adjusting for batch effects (using ComBat)
	- To adjust for the batch effect, I need to figure out which sample came from which data set, then make a model matrix out of that data

===============================================================================

18 July 2016

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Adjusted for the batch effect of the hgu133a microarray data using ComBat

Realised that the batch adjustment standardises the data for you (I think...)

===============================================================================

19 July 2016

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Need to import each HGU133A dataset individually and RMA/MAS5 normalise the data, then combine them and correct for the batch effect

Need to check if the data actually gets standardised after the batch correction

Also, use both probit (pnorm(scale(x))) and rank-based approach to rank the metagene scores

===============================================================================

20 July 2016

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Need to make a function that takes in MAS5 or RMA normalised data and do the metagene analysis.
	- it should allow toggling of probit or rank-based approach
	- should allow standardising or not
	- flipping/direction of metagene should be decided before the function call and given to the function as an argument

===============================================================================

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I have been using read.csv instead of readLines, which meant that I was losing the very first gene in the list of probes for each of the pathways

===============================================================================

1 August 2016

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Make transformation matrix from either the RMA or MAS5 normalised Gatza data, and transfer it to Creighton, FM, Cris, and TCGA data
	- Use the metagene directions from Gatza result

Just realised that I was standardising the data on per-pathway-basis, rather than standardising the whole data first, then pulling out the relvant genes
	- May need to re-do the whole thing (including other metagene stuff)

===============================================================================

2 August 2016

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Need to decide where to make the transformation matrix for the obesity genes
	- for now, I've made the transformation matrix in the Gatza dataset
		- Need to check for the direction of the obesity metagenes in the data set in which the transformation matrix is made in
