Need to start on the differential gene expression analysis for the
cancer types.

Pseudocode/plan:
    - do normal vs overweight and above
    - do normal vs obese
    - confirm Creighton et al obesity related gene probes
    - do DEGs for all cancer types
    - find commonly differentially expressed genes
    - use these genes to find common pathways being dysregulated
        (maybe next task...?)

Start the analysis with Creighton et al data first, confirm the
results, then move onto other cancer data.

Some results from Creighton et al data:
    - for P value < 0.05 (unadjusted):
        - normal vs overweight/obese = 759 genes
        - normal/overweight vs obese = 5278 genes
    - for P value < 0.01 (unadjusted):
        - normal vs overweight/obese = 104 genes
        - normal/overweight vs obese = 1781 genes

Above results were done using FDR control, and there weren't many
DEGs when adjusted P-value was used.
    - These numbers don't really correspond to the original
        Creighton et al results from their paper...

Use the cancer data produced from tidyr (i.e. data from task8)
