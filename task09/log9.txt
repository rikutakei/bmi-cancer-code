Need to start on the differential gene expression analysis for the
cancer types.

Pseudocode/plan:
    - do normal vs overweight and above
    - do normal vs obese
    - confirm Creighton et al obesity related gene probes
    - do DEGs for all cancer types
    - find commonly differentially expressed genes
    - use these genes to find common pathways being dysregulated
        (maybe next task...?)

Start the analysis with Creighton et al data first, confirm the
results, then move onto other cancer data.

Some results from Creighton et al data:
    - for P value < 0.05 (unadjusted):
        - normal vs overweight/obese = 759 genes
        - normal/overweight vs obese = 5278 genes
    - for P value < 0.01 (unadjusted):
        - normal vs overweight/obese = 104 genes
        - normal/overweight vs obese = 1781 genes

Above results were done using FDR control, and there weren't many
DEGs when adjusted P-value was used.
    - These numbers don't really correspond to the original
        Creighton et al results from their paper...

Check if there are any overlaps in the obesity-related genes and
the significant genes

Need to process the data first
    - load data and find which samples have BMI data
    - log the data
    - identify and group the samples into their BMI status

There were NAs introduced after standardising the cancer data and has
been removed
    - note that the number of NAs introduced in each cancer type was
        different, and therefore the number of genes in each cancer
        type are different now
            - may have to adjust the number of genes so that they
                have the same number of genes...

Made top tables for all the cancer types

Realised that you need to use voom normalisation instead of just
logging and standardising.

Made a function to pull out the significant genes

Need to make a venn diagram to see if any overlaps
    - venn diagram only supports 2~5...

There were about 9000 DEGs that were common between all 8 cancer types,
using p value of 0.05.
    - about 3300 gene when p value < 0.01

(from line 95 to line 260)

Noticed that the 9000 genes common weren't actually common
    - they were just total unique genes from all the cancer types,
        rather than common genes.

Need to re-do the common genes thing

Table the genes twice to find how many genes turned up in however many
cancer types.

Talked to Mik:
    - Need to randomly split the samples into two and carry out the DEG
        analysis, then compare this with the results from the obesity
        related samples split (task 10)
    - group obese samples from all the cancer types and use obesity
        related genes to do class prediction (task 11?)

(from line 260 to end)
