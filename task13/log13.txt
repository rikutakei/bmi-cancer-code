----------------------------------------------------------------------

Pre-committee meeting code/results organising
	- compile all of the codes and results so far into a single document

======================================================================

12 May 2016

----------------------------------------------------------------------

There were few samples with extremely high bmi, probably due to an input error
	- swapped the height with weight

For FM transformation matrix, I used adjusted transformation matrix for adjusted/standardised data (i.e. ICGC data), but used raw transformation matrix for raw data (i.e. Creighton data)

======================================================================

27 May 2016

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Was checking for all the metagene directions (both the Gatza and my BMI metagenes)

Made sure that all of the metagenes were going in the same directions

Used the transformation matrix from Creighton data, using the Gatza pathway signatures, instead of applying separate SVD onto each cancer type and getting a metagene from this.

The heatmap created from these metagenes showed a downregulation in 4 cancer types and upregulation in the others in all of the Gatza metagenes that I have flipped.
	- not sure if this result is due to the flipping, or something significant...
	- need to talk to Mik when he's back

======================================================================

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Need to do:
	- check direction of metagenes relative to the important gene(s) for that pathway
	- spearman correlation with BMI to get the genes that are correlated with BMI, rather than genes that are significantly differentially expressed between obese and non-obese group
	- DEG analysis on UCEC data
	- more deeper analysis on the BLCA (on overweight samples being significant than obese, with significant ANOVA p-value)

======================================================================

1 June 2016

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Identified genes to represent for that pathway
	- Some pathwys didn't have an obvious representative gene, so I did some quick search on wiki/kegg/pubmed and took an educated guess for these pathways
		- took a guess for these pathways: BCAT, E2F1, IFNA, IFNG, P53, PI3K, PR, TGFB

the pathways i need to flip are:
	- AKT, E2F1, HER2, IFNA, IFNG, P63, TGFB

======================================================================

2 June 2016

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Flipped the metagenes and made heatmaps and correlation matrix with those metagenes.
	- heatmap.2x was used to show multiple columns
		- did no ordering, ordering by cancer types, and ordering by both cancer types and BMI values

Starting on DEG analysis on Creighton data, using BMI as a continuous variable, not a discrete obese/non-obese variable
	- Need to find a spearman correlation of the genes with BMI values
	- need to scramble the data to find what the cutoff p-values for the genes are, so I can use it to find  the obesity associated genes.
	- Also need to check the overlap between these genes and the discrete-DEGs

The correlation of the genes with BMI gave the highest correlation of 0.41721, so it seems like it's not that great...?
	- check with Mik

Starting DEG analysis on UCEC data, then transforming it on Creighton data and other cancer types

======================================================================

3 June 2016

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Got DEGs from the UCEC data:
	- there were 281 genes with adj.p-value < 0.05 and about 3000 genes with unadjusted p-value < 0.05 (top 799 genes were selected)
	- The metagene made from the genes with significant unadjusted p-value had to be flipped so the scores were gong in the same direction as the gene expression
	- metagene from adjusted p-values didn't need to be flipped, as they were already going in the same direction

======================================================================

UCEC metagenes are both showing "dose-dependent" response (normal < overweight < obese) in the UCEC data.

Checked it in ICGC cancer data, and it seems like all the cancer types (except BLCA overweight samples) correlate with the UCEC obesity-associated genes

TODO:
	1. Re-do the metagene direction stuff
	2. Do the Gatza pathway correlation stuff with the MATLAB colour scheme
	3. Scramble the BMI data and find the right cut-off values for the genes
	that are correlating with BMI
	4. "Play-around" with mclust stuff, using the correlation of genes with BMI
	values (exploring the mixed distribution stuff...?)

======================================================================

14 June 2016

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Did the metagene direction check with MATLAB colour to see if the metagenes are correlating as Gatza et al have shown in their paper
	- The pathways didn't really correlate like in their paper

Downloaded Gatza's original data and checked it in their dataset
	- just used hgu133a data first

Found that the pathway metagene shows better, and more similar clustering when the metagenes are generated from the non-standardised (raw) data, but not from the standardised data

======================================================================

15 June 2016

----------------------------------------------------------------------

REDO THE METAGENE FLIP STUFF!!!
	- find the correlation value of the metagene with its corresponding genes and decide whether to flip it or not
	- make heatmap.2x with the genes, and have the associated gene on the row bar with the metagene

===============================================================================

23 June 2016

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Gatza pathway stuff wasn't looking good in the Creighton data, so going to try the same thing on FM and Cris Print's data

Downloaded Cris' data and removed the HG-U133_Plus_2 stuff from the filenames.

Got the clinical data for 55 samples from Mik

===============================================================================

28 June 2016

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In both Cris' and FM's data, the Gatza metagenes showed similar correlation/clustering as in the original Gatza paper (see gatzameta.R).
	- quality of Creighton's data might have been shit

Checked the association of Creighton's obesity-associated genes with BMI in Cris' data, using transformation matrix made from Creighton data (see crismeta.R)
	- Again, no association with BMI

Need to see whether the BMI metagenes correlated with any of the Gatza pathway metagenes
	- Creighton's data didn't cluster the metagenes as well as Cris' or FM's data, so I'm doing it in Cris' data for now.

First, need to check for the direction of BMI metagenes in Cris' data, so that all the BMI metagenes are facing the right way.
	- Like in Creighton's data, the seventh metagene had to be flipped.

Combine the BMI metagenes with the Gatza pathway metagenes and make a correlation matrix.
	- seems like none of the BMI metagenes are correlating/clustering together with any of the Gatza pathway metagenes

===============================================================================

7 July 2016

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Splitted Cris' data into Auckland A and B, and plotted it with the metagenes created earlier
	- note that the metagenes weren't created separately - they were made using the whole dataset, ranked as a whole, then splitted into different cohorts
	- there is a clear activation of ER/PR/HER2 and deactivation of myc/ras/bcat in auckland A cohort
	  - opposite reults in auckland B cohort (but way more noisier than auckland A)

Looking at DEG in Cris' BC data now
	- started looking at the DEGs using both raw data and standardised data
	  - see if there's any difference in the result...

===============================================================================

8 July 2016

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Did DEGs in both raw and standardised data (366 and 377 genes respectively)

Checked the result in both raw and standardised data for both obesity-associated genes (Identified from raw and standardised data)
	- Both genes were only significant when checked in the standardised data, but not in the raw data

Going to make transformation matrix with both raw and std obesity-associated genes in Cris' data (standardised)
	- these genes were converted into gene symbols and checked to see if they are present in both Cris' and ICGC data

The common genes were still associated with BMI in Cris' data, but the association seems to be weaker than the gene probe IDs
