Pre-committee meeting code/results organising
	- compile all of the codes and results so far into a single document

There were few samples with extremely high bmi, probably due to an input error
	- swapped the height with weight

For FM transformation matrix, I used adjusted transformation matrix for adjusted/standardised data (i.e. ICGC data), but used raw transformation matrix for raw data (i.e. Creighton data)

======================================================================

27 May 2016

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Was checking for all the metagene directions (both the Gatza and my BMI metagenes)

Made sure that all of the metagenes were going in the same directions

Used the transformation matrix from Creighton data, using the Gatza pathway signatures, instead of applying separate SVD onto each cancer type and getting a metagene from this.

The heatmap created from these metagenes showed a downregulation in 4 cancer types and upregulation in the others in all of the Gatza metagenes that I have flipped.
	- not sure if this result is due to the flipping, or something significant...
	- need to talk to Mik when he's back

Need to do:
	- check direction of metagenes relative to the important gene(s) for that pathway
	- spearman correlation with BMI to get the genes that are correlated with BMI, rather than genes that are significantly differentially expressed between obese and non-obese group
	- DEG analysis on UCEC data
	- more deeper analysis on the BLCA (on overweight samples being significant than obese, with significant ANOVA p-value)

======================================================================

1 June 2016

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Identified genes to represent for that pathway
	- Some pathwys didn't have an obvious representative gene, so I did some quick search on wiki/kegg/pubmed and took an educated guess for these pathways
		- took a guess for these pathways: BCAT, E2F1, IFNA, IFNG, P53, PI3K, PR, TGFB

the pathways i need to flip are:
	- AKT, E2F1, HER2, IFNA, IFNG, P63, TGFB

======================================================================

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Flipped the metagenes and made heatmaps and correlation matrix with those metagenes.
	- heatmap.2x was used to show multiple columns
		- did no ordering, ordering by cancer types, and ordering by both cancer types and BMI values

Starting on DEG analysis on Creighton data, using BMI as a continuous variable, not a discrete obese/non-obese variable
	- Need to find a spearman correlation of the genes with BMI values
	- need to scramble the data to find what the cutoff p-values for the genes are, so I can use it to find  the obesity associated genes.
	- Also need to check the overlap between these genes and the discrete-DEGs

The correlation of the genes with BMI gave the highest correlation of 0.41721, so it seems like it's not that great...?
	- check with Mik

Starting DEG analysis on UCEC data, then transforming it on Creighton data and other cancer types

======================================================================

3 June 2016

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Got DEGs from the UCEC data:
	- there were 281 genes with adj.p-value < 0.05 and about 3000 genes with unadjusted p-value < 0.05 (top 799 genes were selected)
	- The metagene made from the genes with significant unadjusted p-value had to be flipped so the scores were gong in the same direction as the gene expression
	- metagene from adjusted p-values didn't need to be flipped, as they were already going in the same direction

======================================================================

UCEC metagenes are both showing "dose-dependent" response (normal < overweight < obese) in the UCEC data.

Checked it in ICGC cancer data, and it seems like all the cancer types (except BLCA overweight samples) correlate with the UCEC obesity-associated genes

TODO:
	1. Re-do the metagene direction stuff
	2. Do the Gatza pathway correlation stuff with the MATLAB colour scheme
	3. Scramble the BMI data and find the right cut-off values for the genes
	that are correlating with BMI
	4. "Play-around" with mclust stuff, using the correlation of genes with BMI
	values (exploring the mixed distribution stuff...?)
