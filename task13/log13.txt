Pre-committee meeting code/results organising

There were few samples with extremely high bmi, probably due to an input error
	- swapped the height with weight

For FM transformation matrix, I used adjusted transformation matrix for adjusted/standardised data (i.e. ICGC data), but used raw transformation matrix for raw data (i.e. Creighton data)

Was checking for all the metagene directions (both the Gatza and my BMI metagenes)

Made sure that all of the metagenes were going in the same directions

Used the transformation matrix from Creighton data, using the Gatza pathway signatures, instead of applying separate SVD onto each cancer type and getting a metagene from this.

The heatmap created from these metagenes showed a downregulation in 4 cancer types and upregulation in the others in all of the Gatza metagenes that I have flipped.
	- not sure if this result is due to the flipping, or something significant...
	- need to talk to Mik when he's back
