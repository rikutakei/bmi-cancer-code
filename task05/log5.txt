Creighton et al data didn't give a great result, so moving onto a different data set

Using the GSE20194 dataset that was used by Fuentes-Mattei et al (2014).
    - Downloaded the data from http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE20194

Unzipped/untarred the file
    - contained 278 CEL files (one for each sample)
    - ls GSM505* > files.txt

Imported the data into Rstudio and RMA normalised the data
    - 22283 gene probes by 278 samples

Need to extract the gene probes that are associated with BMI
    - Use supTab3-fixed.csv file
        - supplementary data from the paper

There are 130 obesity related gene probes, but only 111 unique genes
    - have to collapse some of the probes

The metagene created from the 111 genes seems to capture the overall expression of the Fuentes-Mattei data
    - not sure whether this correlates with obesity (no BMI data for the samples in this dataset)

Check whether the metagene from Fuentes-Mattei data show any correlation/association with the Creighton data
    - This dataset has obesity/BMI information
    - able to see if it really correlates with BMI

Transformed the Creighton dataset, but did not show any significant separation between the obese patients and the normal/overweight patients.
    - Seems like these metagene isn't showing anything significant...
        - Still have to check in other cancer datasets (e.g. UCEC, etc.)
