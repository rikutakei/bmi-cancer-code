Starting the analysis of the cancer data (processed with tidyr)

Imported the cancer data and bmi data into R

======================================================================

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Used icgc_to_tcga function from task 4 to match the sample id in the
bmi data with the cancer data
    - The cancer data have sample ids as their column, so you need to
        change it into rownames first before using the icgc_to_tcga
        function.

Need to identify which samples have bmi data

There are duplicate samples in the cancer data
    - need to identify them and merge them (use WGCNA)

collapseRows function from WGCNA worked on all cancer types, but 
produced warnings
    - "row names of input data and probes not identical ..... check 
        results carefully"

Got all the cancer type data - start the analysis

First, I'll have to use the obesity genes from either the Creighton et
al or Fuentes-mattei et al data
    - start off with Creighton et al data, then F-M data.

Crieghton obesity gene is not in gene symbol format, so convert it into
gene symbols as in task 6
    - 799 gene probes, 695 unique and non-NA genes.

Need to pull out the Creighton obesity genes for each cancer type.
    - some genes are not in the cancer data (have to remove these genes)
    - 647 genes present in the cancer data

Need to make the metagene from the Creighton data first (and also check
again if it correlates with bmi)

Do the analysis on all cancer types
    - REMEMBER TO LOG AND STANDARDISE THE DATA!!

Might as well make a function to do standardisation (and maybe SVD as
well)

Continuing on with the Creighton et al data

Made metagene and heatmap functions to make things easier to program

Standardise_data function somehow transposes the matrix (e.g. sample
changes from columns to rows), so watch out for some bugs.

Make transformation matrix with Creighton metagene and apply it to
other cancer data.
