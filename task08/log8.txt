Starting the analysis of the cancer data (processed with tidyr)

Imported the cancer data and bmi data into R

======================================================================

14 January 2016

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Used icgc_to_tcga function from task 4 to match the sample id in the
bmi data with the cancer data
    - The cancer data have sample ids as their column, so you need to
        change it into rownames first before using the icgc_to_tcga
        function.

Need to identify which samples have bmi data

There are duplicate samples in the cancer data
    - need to identify them and merge them (use WGCNA)

collapseRows function from WGCNA worked on all cancer types, but 
produced warnings
    - "row names of input data and probes not identical ..... check 
        results carefully"
