Starting task 11

Results from task 10 showed that my original results were significant
compared to the randomly sampled data set/group.

However, they probably have a lot of false positives, and will be quite
hard to find which genes are actually significant.
    - have a look at the genes that didn't come up in the randomly
        sampled data
    - do pathway enrichment analysis with the genes.

What to do:
    1) Find genes that are present in the real data, but not in the
        randomly sampled data
            - i.e. DEGs that are not expressed by chance (since all
             of the genes from randomly sampled data are by chance)
    2) Repeat the DEG analysis, but with pathway enrichment analysis
        and look for the pathways that are significant in the real
        data.
            - Do pathway enrichment analysis for every cancer and
                find the common pathways across multiple cancer
                types (then compare it with the real data).
    3) Pull out the t-test scores from the differential expression
        analysis for all the genes that were differentially expressed
        in the cancer types, then create a heatmap to see what t-values
        each cancer types were getting.

1 and 2 are pretty much the same thing - probably do it in the same task.
3 looks easy enough to wedge it into this task as well.

Started working on the pathway analysis
    - using reactome, gene ontology, KEGG, and org.Hs.eg.db databases.

Found a bug in the code from Tom in the GO database bit (line 38 in
Tom's code)
    - The gene symbols were matching different GOID and/or pathway
    - when pulling out GOID from GO.list, some GOIDs had null value,
        and therefore length of tmp becomes smaller than GO.list
            - need to account for this 'loss' of samples.

What Tom's code allows you to do:
    1) ****.list variables store the gene symbols which contains the
        ID for the pathways.
    2) The ID can then be used to search for the pathway(s) by
        referencing the ID with the path* variables.

Not quite sure of how to find significantly enriched pathways...

Only 6750 pathways in the reactome database...??

Need to find significant pathways from DEGs....
    - found a few R packages - going to see what they're like
        - topGO, GOstats, ReactomePA, KEGGprofile, PATHNet
        - EnrichmentBrowser didn't load properly

======================================================================

Need to figure out what the pathway enrichment analysis packages do
( and the theory behind it ).
    - probably need to write my own function on the way

Some pseudocode:
    - get list of DEGs
    - within these DEGs, how many genes are involved in a specific
        pathway?
    - out of all the DEGs pulled out, is the number of genes associated
        with the pathway statistically significant?
            - yes = pathway enriched, no = not enriched
    - repeat for all pathway

I need to tweak the sample_test function so that it does the pathway
enrichment analysis after each DEG analysis
    - first make a function to do the pathway enrichment analysis
    - need a pre-made matrix of gene-by-pathways for Fisher's test
        - might have to make one for each database...?

Thought I've debugged GO pathway from Tom's code, but seems like I
haven't processed it properly...
    - When pulling out GOID, some of them remains as list, instead of
        vector of GOIDs
            - i.e. list of list
            - might have to re-do the for-loop until no list is included

======================================================================

1 March 2016

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Started making a gene-by-pathway matrix
    - not sure using a for-loop is a good idea/elegant...?

Decided to use for-loop instead of apply
    - too hard to implement in apply function

After making the for-loop, use ifelse function to make it into a 0/1
matrix

Need to do this for all pathway databases

======================================================================

2 March 2016

----------------------------------------------------------------------

KEGG and reactome pathways weren't as bad, but GO pathway database
had way too many pathways for R to handle (like 40000 pathways)
    - need to select for appropriate genes and pathways.

Save the files as txt

======================================================================

4 March 2016

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Got all the gene by pathway matrices
    - starting the analysis now

Haven't done all of the analyses, but noticed that some pathways have
very few genes, and when these genes come up in the list of DEGs, it
becomes significant...
    - is this right?
    - how does picking out 2 genes make the pathway "enriched"?

======================================================================

7 March 2016

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Changed the pathenrich function slightly
    - use the whole db variable instead of pulling out 'relevant'
        genes and/or pathways

Due to the size of the TFmatrices, KEGG is the fastest, then reactome,
then GO database
    - but GO has the most pathways, and therefore most detailed ()

Need to do the path enrichment analysis on original ob vs lean/ov
data to get the list of pathways we're looking for
    - then do pathway enrichment on random groups for the same data
        and look for the pathways that didn't show up in the random
        samples


======================================================================

9 March 2016

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Added lapply for adding adjusted p-values, using FDR (Benjamini Hochberg)

Changed the lapply into mcapply

======================================================================

11 March 2016

----------------------------------------------------------------------

mclapply version was taking forever (not sure why...)
    - reverted it back to the lapply version (worked fine, and
        somehow very fast)

Ready to do the however many iterations of pathway enrichment analysis
for each cancer type.

Pseudocode for the iteration:
    - for each list element (i.e. cancer), make a matrix of p-values
        to get a pathway by p-value matrix
            - each column of p-value is from a single pathway
                enrichment analysis
    - after this list of pathway by p-values are made, need to adjust
        it via BH/FDR method
    - need to assign 0 or 1 for signaificant or non-significant
        pathways, then count them all up (i.e. table() it)

Do a test run to see if it works
