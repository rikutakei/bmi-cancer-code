Starting task 11

Results from task 10 showed that my original results were significant
compared to the randomly sampled data set/group.

However, they probably have a lot of false positives, and will be quite
hard to find which genes are actually significant.
    - have a look at the genes that didn't come up in the randomly
        sampled data
    - do pathway enrichment analysis with the genes.

What to do:
    1) Find genes that are present in the real data, but not in the
        randomly sampled data
            - i.e. DEGs that are not expressed by chance (since all
             of the genes from randomly sampled data are by chance)
    2) Repeat the DEG analysis, but with pathway enrichment analysis
        and look for the pathways that are significant in the real
        data.
            - Do pathway enrichment analysis for every cancer and
                find the common pathways across multiple cancer
                types (then compare it with the real data).
    3) Pull out the t-test scores from the differential expression
        analysis for all the genes that were differentially expressed
        in the cancer types, then create a heatmap to see what t-values
        each cancer types were getting.

1 and 2 are pretty much the same thing - probably do it in the same task.
3 looks easy enough to wedge it into this task as well.

Started working on the pathway analysis
    - using reactome, gene ontology, KEGG, and org.Hs.eg.db databases.

Found a bug in the code from Tom in the GO database bit (line 38 in
Tom's code)
    - The gene symbols were matching different GOID and/or pathway
    - when pulling out GOID from GO.list, some GOIDs had null value,
        and therefore length of tmp becomes smaller than GO.list
            - need to account for this 'loss' of samples.

What Tom's code allows you to do:
    1) ****.list variables store the gene symbols which contains the
        ID for the pathways.
    2) The ID can then be used to search for the pathway(s) by
        referencing the ID with the path* variables.

Not quite sure of how to find significantly enriched pathways...

Only 6750 pathways in the reactome database...??

Need to find significant pathways from DEGs....
    - found a few R packages - going to see what they're like
        - topGO, GOstats, ReactomePA, KEGGprofile, PATHNet
        - EnrichmentBrowser didn't load properly

Need to figure out what the pathway enrichment analysis packages do
( and the theory behind it ).
    - probably need to write my own function on the way

Some pseudocode:
    - get list of DEGs
    - within these DEGs, how many genes are involved in a specific
        pathway?
    - out of all the DEGs pulled out, is the number of genes associated
        with the pathway statistically significant?
            - yes = pathway enriched, no = not enriched
    - repeat for all pathway

I need to tweak the sample_test function so that it does the pathway
enrichment analysis after each DEG analysis
    - first make a function to do the pathway enrichment analysis
    - need a pre-made matrix of gene-by-pathways for Fisher's test
        - might have to make one for each database...?

Thought I've debugged GO pathway from Tom's code, but seems like I
haven't processed it properly...
    - When pulling out GOID, some of them remains as list, instead of
        vector of GOIDs
            - i.e. list of list
            - might have to re-do the for-loop until no list is included

Started making a gene-by-pathway matrix
    - not sure using a for-loop is a good idea/elegant...?
